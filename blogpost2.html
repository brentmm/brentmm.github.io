					<p>Hi again, and welcome to my second-ever blog post. As a refresher, my name is Brent, and I am a
						second-year IT software development student, approaching graduation. In this blog, I will be
						taking a deeper look into some of Microsoft Azure’s most popular services, so if you have not
						already, I would suggest reading my first blog posting where I gave a detailed overview of what
						Microsoft Azure is and how it works; I also explained how I was able to host a website using
						Azure services. To get started, in my previous post I addressed four of Azure’s most popular
						service categories and gave brief details of what you can achieve by using them. These services
						were web, computing, database, and networking. At the end of my earlier post, I went into detail
						and walked you through the steps needed to create a web app hosted on Azure, so today we are
						going to focus on the three other types of services that I touched on.

						<br><br>In today's blog post we are going to start with Azure computer services. These services allow
						you to access infrastructure where you can run your applications: this could be a new
						application, or you could deploy an existing one onto their servers. These services are
						extremely scalable so no matter what your demand is, it will be met. Another advantage of these
						services is that they support hybrid environments (an environment that uses on-premises, private
						cloud, and third-party cloud): this provides tons of flexibility and choice of where and how you
						deploy your applications, and it also uses a pay-as-you-go, meaning you are only paying for what
						you need and use. That gives a general summary of all the computer services Azure offers, but
						out of the eleven services they offer I am going to be looking at virtual machines.<br><br>

						<br><br>In Azure, the most popular computing service is a VM. You can choose a Windows or Linux VM and
						can customize the instance to whatever settings are right for you; this also allows you to be in
						control of the cost. Azure claims that they have the best and fairest prices for VMs compared to
						other cloud computing providers, which has to do with how they only charge you for what you use.
						When you set up a VM it will work with many applications, so there is no need to worry about
						compatibility issues, but before you set up your VM you first need to choose one of the eleven
						options. All of these options are perfected for different tasks and need to provide you with the
						best performance possible and there is no limit: you can have a single VM up to and over a
						thousand. After you set up your VM instance you can manage it from the dashboard. The dashboard
						is easy to read, well-organized, and is the one location where you can monitor, control, or
						backup your VM. Within the dashboard you can also configure your settings further, such as
						encrypting data, securing network traffic, setting up defenses to protect against threats, and
						is altogether a location where you can ensure that your VM meets regulations and compliance
						requirements. Not that you have to worry, because right at setup Azure VMs already meet many
						international and industry set standards. The other topic Microsoft stresses about their VMs is
						security; it is taken very seriously right from the boot. Azure VMs use a trusted launch feature
						to prevent threats at boot, allow you to turn on confidential computing to secure your data, and
						right in the dashboard you can view a security breakdown and see possible vulnerabilities.
						Another cool feature that relates to security is the option to have a dedicated host that Azure
						isolates, so it is only used by you. I will be demonstrating how to set up a VM in Azure, but
						there are also videos provided by Microsoft that can get you running a VM in five minutes, so
						check those out if you are interested.

						<br><br>The next category I am going to discuss is storage. Since many of us have become used to cloud
						storage this category is straightforward. Azure provides scalable, secure, performant,
						cost-effective options to store your data in the cloud. They have seven different storage
						services which allow you to handle your data differently, including disk storage, data lake
						storage, file storage, blob storage, archive storage, data box (data transfer to compute
						services), files shares stored and powered by NetApp, and finally Azure backup. The service I
						chose to look into is Azure disk storage, which is a high-performance, durable block storage.<br><br>

						<img class="image fit" src="images/B2-Harddisk.jpg" alt="Harddisk" >
						<figcaption class="align-center">Harddisk - Credit to Owner</figcaption>

						<br><br>When it comes to storage, Azure disk storage is one of the more common options. It allows you to
						store as much data as you need. It has disk sizes ranging from four gigabytes to sixty-four
						terabytes that all have a zero percent annual failure rate. All disk storage has built-in
						security to protect your data, and they supply the possibility to enable incremental snapshots
						to add redundancy. There are also a few more redundancy options that copy your data across
						multiple server zones to ensure the protection and integrity of your data. When looking at data
						security Azure offers a few different types of encryptions, so you can choose the method that
						works best for you; you can also set up role-based access to manage and control access and view
						permissions, and for even more security you can set up Azure private link to manage access to
						your storage. When creating a storage instance, it is very easy to create and manage your disk
						type and size, and you can configure the I/O, throughput, and capacity that you need. On Azure
						disk storage you can also choose to use relational databases, NoSQL databases, backups/disaster
						recovery, clustered applications, and containerized workloads. Additionally, a recently-added
						feature that Microsoft is testing out is a storage solution called Azure VMware solutions, for
						which they have partnered with VMware to create a durable storage system for
						data-intensive/transaction-heavy workloads.

						<br><br>The last popular category I am going to look at is Azure networking. The network has over two
						hundred and sixty KMs of private fiber connecting more than sixty regions, creating more than
						one hundred and seventy PoP (point of presence) networks to access. All network services are
						scalable, consistent, have high performance and availability, strong security, and low latency,
						and by using Azure ExpressRoute you can reach routing speeds of up to one hundred GBPS. Network
						types include on-premises, multi-cloud, and edge location networks. After setting up a network
						you can choose how traffic will be routed by setting up routing preferences, which adds security
						and efficiency. In order to protect applications that run on your network, Azure provides WAF
						and Bastion security options, and all networks are DDoS protected. From the dashboard you can
						set up a virtual WAN, configure firewall settings and set rules that control traffic; another
						feature is the ability to view and monitor the global routes. All virtual networks use the Zero
						trust security model: a model that grants remote access based on set policies. If that is not
						secure enough for you, Azure gives you the ability to have a private connection to your network
						using Azure private link, which is one of the twenty-six services you can choose from the five
						networking categories.<br><br>

						<img class="image fit" src="images/B2-Cable.jpg" alt="Azure Networking" >
						<figcaption class="align-center">Microsoft Azure Networking Services - Credit to Owner</figcaption>

						<br><br>Out of those services I selected to investigate Azure virtual networks. This allows developers
						to build, manage, and secure cloud networks. Security includes using the Azure VPN, or Azure
						ExpressRoute, two options that create encrypted connections to your network. If you are
						switching your network onto Azure they allow you to use your IP address and DNS, and if you do
						not have one then Azure will dynamically assign one. Once a network is set up you have granular
						control between subnets, where you can create isolated secure environments for applications, and
						since these networks are virtual it allows you to create complex topologies. More advanced
						security privacy policies can be set on global resources to enforce who can access these, and
						there is also the choice to use hub and spoke mesh networks that further enforce security
						requirements by using isolated private IPs, subnets, and individual policies. The benefits of
						using an Azure network service are that it allows you to work with existing or new developments
						without having to manually configure everything; it also allows you to extend your current data
						center onto the cloud, and if you rely strictly on Azure networks it reduces latency and
						improves security since there is no need to connect to public networks.

						<br><br>That brings us to the end of my blog post. Hopefully, you enjoyed the deep dive into some of
						Microsoft Azure’s services in their most popular categories and were able to get a good idea of
						what these services have to offer. If you are interested in learning more about anything I
						talked about or even briefly mentioned check out the Microsoft Azure website as they have tons
						of resources to better your knowledge about cloud computing, and they also provide so many free
						courses/videos you can follow along with. In my final words, I guess I will just leave you with
						my suggestion of learning how to work with cloud computing because as time moves forward and
						evolves, it will become extremely popular, more than it is now, and it will be a great asset to
						have on your resume and alongside your name.
